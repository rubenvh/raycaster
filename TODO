- IMPROVE: bsp representation should only be removed when physically changing the geometry (moving, adding, deleting elements)
- GEOMETRY: allow batch edit multiple edges (via tree view checkboxes ?)
- GENERAL: style edit edge component
- RENDERING: slower fps slows down movement => normalize this
- BUG: completely translucent (invisible) edge is being drawn as fading shadow
- BUG: when selecting multiple adjacent polygons, the highlighted edge (green) might be overdrawn by 1 of the polygon's edges
- BUG: when loading files, texture library receives new textures that are already loaded
- BSP: allow adding hinting split planes drawn by the user
- RENDERING: implement sprites: represent as directed (short) line segments
- RENDERING: implement doors
- RENDERING: luminosity on edge as a function of time to implement flickering 
- RENDERING: implement mirror walls
- GEOMETRY: expand polygon: AS IS: push out walls from center => TO BE would be nice to stay parallel to existing edges



 WOULD BE NICE
-=============-
- MAPEDITOR: clickable scrollbars
- MENU: disable menu items when not appropriate
