- refactor 2d view into separate class
- refactor drawing primitives into separate file
- simplify camera calculations by introducing pos, dir and plane vectors
- when moving camera: send ray for fwd/back + sidestep movements => when distance of collision is smaller than some threshold => movement blocked
- add linter
- select with right click
- ability to move selection (drag & drop) + snap to 20x20 grid
- display selected item's JSON + ability to change
- load textures in a virtual canvas
- draw texture on wall column (copying from virtual canvas)
- atmospheric lightning (tunnel effect = reduce luminosity of walls further away, mist = dampen color of walls further away)
