- add linter
- ability to create new polygon
- display selected item's JSON (or intersection when multiple items are selected)
- modify selected item's JSON and save it (or intersection when multiple items are selected)
- ability to select region (vertices + edges)
- load textures in a virtual canvas
- draw texture on wall column (copying from virtual canvas)
- store textures in localstorage? 
- atmospheric lightning (tunnel effect = reduce luminosity of walls further away, mist = dampen color of walls further away)
- add bounding box when storing a polygon
- reduce intersection tests by testing bounding box first
- highlight edges that are being tested for intersection
- implement BSP or quadtree structure to further reduce intersection tests
- implement scrolling in 2d view
- implement zooming in 2d view (+ impact on distance threshold for selection)
- implement mirror walls
- implement doors
- ability to select region (vertices + edges)
- adapt remove vertex, remove edge to support multiple selected elements ?
