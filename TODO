- add linter
- remove material at face
- toggle texture key (ctrl-T) should open popup with scrollable popup of all textures
- luminosity on edge as a function of time to implement flickering 
- store texture library inside map as base64 string
- BUG: completely translucent (invisible) edge is being drawn as fading shadow
- BUG: split polygon broken due to selection component
- BUG: expand polygon broken due to selection component
- disable menu items when not appropriate
- highlight edges that are being tested for intersection
- implement scrolling in 2d view
- implement zooming in 2d view (+ impact on distance threshold for selection?)
- implement mirror walls
- implement doors
- expand polygon: AS IS: push out walls from center => TO BE would be nice to stay parallel to existing edges
- slower fps slows down movement => normalize this
- implement sprites
- implement BSP or quadtree structure to further reduce intersection tests
- collision detection for moving camera should include distance (only detect collisions with geometry close to camera position)
