- TEXTURES: adapt cols/rows for texture in library
- remove material at face
- toggle texture key (ctrl-T) should open popup with scrollable popup of all textures
- luminosity on edge as a function of time to implement flickering 
- store texture library inside map as base64 string
- BUG: completely translucent (invisible) edge is being drawn as fading shadow
- BUG: when selecting multiple adjacent polygons, the highlighted edge (green) might be overdrawn by 1 of the polygon's edges
- BSP: try different split plane selection strategy (e.g. alternating horizontal/vertical split on center of combined bounding box)
- BSP: allow adding hinting split planes drawn by the user
- disable menu items when not appropriate
- implement scrolling in 2d view
- implement zooming in 2d view (+ impact on distance threshold for selection?)
- implement mirror walls
- implement doors
- expand polygon: AS IS: push out walls from center => TO BE would be nice to stay parallel to existing edges
- slower fps slows down movement => normalize this
- implement sprites
- add linter
