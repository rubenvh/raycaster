- add linter
- BUG: splitting edge does not copy material
- recalculate bounding box for polygons with moved edges/vertices (make immutable like the other operations)- 
- display stats in statusbar
- optimize canvas drawing performance: try single beginpath + fill operation for all walls, create column map, round coordinates
- support for splitting a polygon into 2 (when selecting 2 vertices => introduce new edge in 2 sets)
- display selected item's JSON (or intersection when multiple items are selected)
- modify selected item's JSON and save it (or intersection when multiple items are selected)
- ability to select region (vertices + edges)
- load textures in a virtual canvas
- draw texture on wall column (copying from virtual canvas)
- store textures in localstorage? 
- atmospheric lightning (tunnel effect = reduce luminosity of walls further away, mist = dampen color of walls further away)
- reduce intersection tests by testing bounding box first
- highlight edges that are being tested for intersection
- implement BSP or quadtree structure to further reduce intersection tests
- implement scrolling in 2d view
- implement zooming in 2d view (+ impact on distance threshold for selection)
- implement mirror walls
- implement doors
- ability to select region (vertices + edges)
- adapt remove vertex, remove edge to support multiple selected elements ?
