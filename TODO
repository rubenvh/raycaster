- MAPEDITOR: when zooming in -> use mouse position as target area for zooming
- GEOMETRY: adapt EditEdgeComponent to select texture from library (dropdown?)
- GEOMETRY: edit material on both faces of an edge
- GEOMETRY: remove material at face
- RENDERING: slower fps slows down movement => normalize this
- BUG: completely translucent (invisible) edge is being drawn as fading shadow
- BUG: when selecting multiple adjacent polygons, the highlighted edge (green) might be overdrawn by 1 of the polygon's edges
- BSP: allow adding hinting split planes drawn by the user
- RENDERING: implement sprites: represent as directed (short) line segments
- RENDERING: implement doors
- RENDERING: luminosity on edge as a function of time to implement flickering 
- RENDERING: implement mirror walls
- GEOMETRY: expand polygon: AS IS: push out walls from center => TO BE would be nice to stay parallel to existing edges



 WOULD BE NICE
-=============-
- MAPEDITOR: clickable scrollbars
- MENU: disable menu items when not appropriate
