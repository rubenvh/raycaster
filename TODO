- add linter
- display stats in statusbar
- toggle texture key (ctrl-T) should open popup with scrollable popup of all textures
- override dynamic lightning strategy by explicitly setting luminosity and fading parameters on edges
- luminosity on edge as a function of time to implement flickering 
- store texture library inside map as base64 string
- display selected item's properties in UI (polygon, edge or vertex) (or intersection when multiple items are selected?)
- modify selected item's JSON and save it (or intersection when multiple items are selected)
- disable menu items when not appropriate
- highlight edges that are being tested for intersection
- implement scrolling in 2d view
- implement zooming in 2d view (+ impact on distance threshold for selection?)
- implement mirror walls
- implement doors
- expand polygon: AS IS: push out walls from center => TO BE would be nice to stay parallel to existing edges
- slower fps slows down movement => normalize this
- implement sprites
- implement BSP or quadtree structure to further reduce intersection tests
- collision detection for moving camera should include distance (only detect collisions with geometry close to camera position)
gave up (deemed unimportant) :)
- fix ts code map (for debugging in dev tools)
