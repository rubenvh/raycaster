- add linter
- fix ts code map (for debugging in dev tools)
- display stats in statusbar
- support for splitting a polygon into 2 (when selecting 2 vertices => introduce new edge in 2 sets)
- support for transforming a polygon when edge is selected: remove edge and make polygon form solid (trace it)
- clone selected polygons
- change fading strategy on key press (null, dark or mist)
- right-click geometry to show menu
- undo/redo service
- toggle texture key (ctrl-T) should open popup with scrollable popup of all textures
- display selected item's JSON (or intersection when multiple items are selected)
- modify selected item's JSON and save it (or intersection when multiple items are selected)
- reduce intersection tests by testing bounding box first
- highlight edges that are being tested for intersection
- implement BSP or quadtree structure to further reduce intersection tests
- implement scrolling in 2d view
- implement zooming in 2d view (+ impact on distance threshold for selection)
- implement mirror walls
- implement doors
- add circles to geometry to represent sprites ? (no we need direction, ellipse ?)
